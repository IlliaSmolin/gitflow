Connecting to the repository (when working on a new host)
git init //initialize local repository, does only once in the new working directory
git clone %URL% //where %URL% is the URI of the remote repository on the "GitHub" you wish to download

Pulling last changes from remote to local repository (you should pull the latest changes to the local "master" branch, so we will switch to the master first)
git fetch //load the latest info (about branches and changes) from GitHub to your Git
git checkout master //switching to the local master branch
git status //check if your code is up to date with the remote origin/master branch
git pull //downloading the latest changes from the remote origin/master branch to your local master branch

How to work with files when you have the latest code on your local master branch
git checkout -b %newBranchName% //creating and switching to the new branch with %newBranchName% (don't worry, it will save all your latest changes from the local master branch)
*Now you can safely change any files, any code, develop new features, e.t.c.*

How to push your changes from the local branch to remote branch (and create the remote branch with the changes)
git status //to see which files were changed, added, deleted on your local branch
git add . //add ALL changed files to the next commit body
git commit -m "Commit Name" //create new "ready for push" commit with your changes
git push //push the latest changes to the remote branch (if remote branch with the name of your %activeLocalBranch% is absent - git will advise you the command how to create it and push to it immediately
*after this you should open GitHub and merge the pull request from the remote branch to the "origin/master"*

How to pull changes from certain remote branch
git checkout --track origin/%branch_name% //create a branch (with the similar name of the remote branch) and connect it with the remote branch
